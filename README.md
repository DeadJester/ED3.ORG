Before spinning up new pages the index.html s second style sheet needs to be copied over to the rest of the pages.
i thought i had taken care of that 
at some point there will be a couple of cache and expiration meta tags added once i find them for small amounts of added security
as of 10/17/17 work and github are up to date 
make sure the JS path is correct 
there are a few that still have out of date nav bars 




these will cover most browsers  for disabling the cache
"<meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache" />
<meta http-equiv="expires" content="0" />
<meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache" />"

some security stuff to add to the meta 
"<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" content="deny">"
more to follow
