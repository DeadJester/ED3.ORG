Before spinning up new pages the index.html s second style sheet needs to be copied over to the rest of the pages.
i thought i had taken care of that 
at some point there will be a couple of cache and expiration meta tags added once i find them for small amounts of added security
as of 10/17/17 work and github are up to date 
make sure the JS path is correct 
there are a few that still have out of date nav bars
